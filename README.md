# FFD-lib
FFD library with parallel loops. required for GH_Wind

Modified after: https://github.com/lukasbystricky/GSoC_FFD


To Do:
- [ ] bug: pressure field keeps updating in an open domain
- [ ] add energy transportation (Boussinesque approximation)
- [ ] add pollution transportation (Fick's law)
- [ ] add numeric convergence indicators
- [ ] try different PDE solvers (multigrid, conjugate gradient, TDMA...?) 
<br></br>
- [ ] parallelize on GPU
<br></br>
- [ ] meta models for spatially resolved effective viscosity
